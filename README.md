Client server communication with a drone and a gopro camera. 
It uses a live stream from the gopro camera to let you choose an object,
that object will be tracked and centered so the drone ( which has a gopro camera attached to it ) keeps an eye on it.
You can control the drone and where it flies with the keyboard, take pictures and
the drone will rotate automatically to center the tracked object on the gopro camera.
